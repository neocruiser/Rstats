R scripts in computational biology targeting data in human genetics. This is part of a postdoc research at UVM. Mostly, statistical inferences that cover descriptive stats and machine learning. 

The project will include an analytical pipeline that will combine quantitative traits and genetic variation.
The hypothesis is that common diseases are caused by common variants. In the case of small effect size, the common variant has restricted impact on the inheritance of the disease. Consequently, the variation can be caused by multiple genetic factors.

The project starts officially in December 2014. It will include mostly R and perl scripts (scriptology), and overall will focus on engineering analytical pipelines.
